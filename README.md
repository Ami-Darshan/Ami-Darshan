Hello, I'm Darshan Poudel, currently navigating my eleventh year of school. My journey into the realm of coding commenced at the age of eleven in the ninth grade, fueled by a profound interest in robotics. Over the years, my passion for this field has led me to numerous victories in Robotics Championships and Olympiads. Currently, I am on the brink of unveiling my meticulously crafted basic robot, and my endeavors extend beyond robotics to include web development and Android app creation. With a flair for developing cool websites, I am enthusiastic about exploring the endless possibilities that the world of technology has to offer.
